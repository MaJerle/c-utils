# Before this file is included to the root CMakeLists file (using include() function), user can set some variables:
#
# LWUTIL_COMPILE_OPTIONS: If defined, it provide compiler options for generated library.
# LWUTIL_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS: If defined, it provides "-D" definitions to the library build
#

# Custom include directory

)

# Setup include directories
set(lwutil_include_DIRS
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/src/include
    ${LWUTIL_CUSTOM_INC_DIR}
